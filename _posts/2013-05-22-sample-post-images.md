### Scrum Board Organization

Scrum Board will be well organized. All tasks will be created as issues that are delegated to certain people. When tasks are finished, they will be moved from the "In-progress" column to "Completed" column. All old tasks (from the previous week or sprint weeks) should be moved to the "Backlog" column.

#### Review Column
The Review column will contain a Review ticket for the Friday/Monday Delivery. It will contain an organized compilation of all the requirements for that week, with links to tangibles. As tasks are completed, our Deployment Manager will update the deployed website with all relevant updates.

### How we deal with issues

Any issues that come up with the Scrum Board will be dealt with as a team, with the Scrum Master facilitating conversation between team members. Issues from Teacher or Crossover will be marked down on the Review Ticket, and new tickets will be assigned accordingly to deal with those issues.

To better manage the Scrum Team, Scrum Board, and issues, this trimester will consist of better organization. This includes proper use of the different columns as specified above and updating all issues with tangibles as they are completed.
