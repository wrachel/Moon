This team was formed by Del Norte High School Students as part of their AP Computer Science A class, where they were tasked to create a project idea as well as do many other "mini tasks".

In their website, which can be found at [https://taxevasion.pentahex.xyz/](https://taxevasion.pentahex.xyz/), you will seeour project idea (a password manager), as well as other related features. Under the "minilabs" portion, there contains individual about pages for each person. These mostly have our Collegeboard FRQs as well as other "mini" features such as web API's, and more.

## Bryant

Bryant is a very cool guy! He's really, insanely good at coding and lowkey (highkey) carries us through everything. We love and appreciate Byrant!

He is also very sarcastic but overall knowledgeable and a great teammate who only *sometimes* get's mad at you. 

## Kevin

Kevin is our super talented design person. He has taken care of most of the css/html/pretty features on our website. The little button you click to change to dark/light mode was made by him. Our nice layout to look fancy was also made by him. 

He's a really hardworking guy who I appreciate on the team. He'll work extensively without being asked and always helps out if you ask him a question. A nice guy!

## Harry

Harry is *officially* our deployment manager. I feel bad for that one time where I kept yelling at him to update our deployed website, but otherwise he does his job very well! He keeps team spirits up and even if his honoring the "holy" scrum master is lowkey creepy, he's a funny guy who lifts team spirits up. 

He also wants to help out when possible, which I appreciate!

## Rachel

Ah, as the author of this blog it feels weird to praise myself, but how could I not when I am so talented, amazing, hardworking, organized, considerate, and thorough?

Oh, and our team's scrum master of course because, like, who else would it be?
