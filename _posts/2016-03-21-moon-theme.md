<center><b>Tax Evaders</b> created this password manager.</center>


## Using the Password Manager
Navigate to [https://taxevasion.pentahex.xyz/](https://taxevasion.pentahex.xyz/).

Here you will be able to see our password manager and all the other features included such as:
* Password Checker
* Password Generator
* Minilabs and about pages with Collegeboard FRQs for each individual
* The actual password manager, with sign in and sign up functionality.

That's all.
