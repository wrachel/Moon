Layout Flowchart created by Layout and Design Manager, Kevin.

The flowchart describes the basic structure of each website, which contains a head and body. I chose to not include a footer at the moment, but it may be added in the future to make the website look more professional somehow. The head contains the[head file](https://github.com/wrachel/TaxEvaders/blob/main/src/main/resources/templates/fragments/head.html) and the title, which shows on the tab in your favorite browser. The body has the navbar and the body content. The body content is customizable on each page. All the other elements basically stay constant, except the title.
