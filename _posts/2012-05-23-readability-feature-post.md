## Why a password manager?

Us at the Tax Evaders team really believe in helping people store their passwords. The idea was inspired from our fellow founders who struggled to remember passwords for the many websites and services they have signed up for, and have constantly had to reset their password. 

As the internet, and number of online serves, expand, secure password storage is becoming even more necessary since using the same password can be insecure. I can speak to my own personal experiences where writing down passwords manually can be inconvenient when out of the house.


## Our First Brain Write (Ah, good memories.)

 * password storage functionality
 ** store passwords in a secure hashed form
 * robust password input system
 ** hardened against injection attacks to prevent database leakage
 * password strength checker (available for use without user account)
 ** input password
 ** output strength level based on character types and length, etc.
 * user login
 ** passwords protected behind authentication requirements
 ** users must log in to view their own passwords
 ** optional 2FA capabilities
 Our name will be Nighthawk Security Application
 
## Design Ideas
Well, we need a consistent theme (thanks kevin!).

### Database Usage
The Database is very key to our project, since it's what stores the users passwords. We will also be implementing encryption to keep passwords secure.

### Navigation Bar using boostratp layouts. 
Navigation Bar should include
* an about us section with individual about pages.
* Login page that redirects to: Password display page that shows passwords and allows users to keep new ones
* Password Checker
* Some kind of Jekyll/media incorporation (links to Github README)
* Random Password Generator Light/Dark Mode Functionality
